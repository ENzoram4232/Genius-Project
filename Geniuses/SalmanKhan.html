                    Sal’s interest in education began while he was an undergraduate at MIT. While there, he developed math software for children with ADHD and tutored fourth- and seventh-grade public school students in Boston. Sal also taught test prep courses for the MCAT and was named Teacher of the Year by a national test prep company. He holds three degrees from MIT and an MBA from Harvard Business School.

                    Sal founded Khan Academy as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in 2008. Khan Academy’s platform includes more than 70,000 practice problems as well as videos and articles that cover a range of K–12 subjects. Khan Academy’s learning system is mastery based, which allows students to master key concepts at a pace that’s right for them before moving on to more challenging content. The organization partners with school districts across the country and around the world that serve students who are historically under-resourced. In the United States, school districts use Khan Academy Districts and MAP Accelerator to help teachers differentiate instruction. More than 18 million learners use Khan Academy every month in 190 countries and 51 languages.
