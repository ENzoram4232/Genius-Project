                In what was the second-largest full-color video display in the U.S, MIT students made history with the Tetris hack on April 20, 2012. This hack used the windows on the front of the Green Building to create a 17x9 pixelated screen as a playable Tetris game board. With each window illuminated by an LED light system, passersby could manipulate the Tetris pieces using a controller that was attached to a nearby booth. The game was equipped with three levels: after the first, the colors got paler and paler, making the blocks harder to distinguish. Players would joke that their bad scores could be broadcast across the river -- perhaps the one downside of an immensely cool project. After the hack, the students published the software they used, and created a suggestion board, so that there would be a wide range of possibilities for future generations to create.
