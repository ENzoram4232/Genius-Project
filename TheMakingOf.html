                <h3>While conducting research for the Looking Glass, we stumbled upon the Entrepreneur’s Walk of Fame in Kendall Square. Created in 2011 and patterned after the Hollywood Walk of Fame, it was meant to recognize trailblazers in the information age. </h3>
                <h3>Seven of the brightest minds in the history of business were recognized, including Bill Gates, Bill Hewlett, Bob Swanson, David Packard, Mitch Kapor, Steve Jobs and Thomas Edison. The goal was to keep such innovative figures alive in the minds of students, tourists, and curious passersby.</h3>

                <h3>In 2018, we partnered with MIT to tell the story of Cambridge’s inventive spirit in a more inclusive manner. From the first center-aisle train car to Thomas Watson and Alexander Graham Bell completing the first phone call, to invention of the Polaroid camera, and now home of incredible innovative biotech startups, Main Street has been the central artery of Kendall Square.</h3>
                <h3>One doesn’t have to wander to far from the main boulevard to discover stories like Dr. Ronald McNair MIT-trained physicist and astronaut tragically killed in the failed Space Shuttle Challenger mission. He would walk across Main Street several times per week to teach karate class at St. Paul AME Church in the Port neighborhood in Cambridge. The Port is the most economically challenged neighborhood in Cambridge. Our installation will honor Dr. McNair and others who have helped Kendall Square become know as the most innovative square mile on the planet.</h3>
